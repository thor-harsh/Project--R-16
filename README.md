# Project--R-16

**In this project we make the use of iris dataset**.<br><br/>
The iris dataset is a built-in dataset in R that contains measurements on 4 different attributes (in centimeters) for 50 flowers from 3 different species.
These measures were used to create a knn clustering model to cluster the 3 different species.
The dataset is often used in data mining, classification and clustering examples and to test algorithms.
Here I have also plotted clusplot for plotting our and visualizing the different cluster based on 3 different species.

**so what are waiting for..? Jump to the code to get started to learn to make this amazing cluster project. As usual for any query or suggestion see you in pull request section 😁😂. Thanks!**
